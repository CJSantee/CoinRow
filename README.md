# CoinRow
Custom implementation of the traditional Coin Row Problem, designed for CS 3623 (Design and Analysis of Algorithms)
There are n houses built in a line, each of which contains some value in it. A thief is going to steal the maximal value in these houses, but he cannot steal in two adjacent houses because the owner of a stolen house will tell his two neighbors on the left and right side. What is the maximal stolen value?
